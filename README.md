# Minishell_42

## What is a shell? :thinking: ## 
  Basically in an operating system there are these two elements:
  <br>
    * The kernel (= kernel): which performs the fundamental functions of 
                    the operating system such as memory management, processes, files ...
  <br>
    * The shell: At its base, a shell is simply a macro processor that executes commands. 
                -The term macro processor means functionality where text and symbols are expanded to create larger expressions.
                -A Unix shell is both a command interpreter and a programming language.
